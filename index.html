							<h2>Activity</h2>
							<p>
								In Informatics, we put people first. We think of the user and their diverse needs and challenges. We design technology solutions that work for <i>people</i> - and then build them. 
								Todays activity is focused on <i><a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking">design thinking</a></i>.
								<br>
								Utilizing core Informatics concepts, we will put aside
								the coding, and focus on the user. 
								<br><br>
								You will <b>empathise</b>, <b>ideate</b>, and <b>prototype</b>.
								<br>
								You will work with your team to design a digital solution to a complex social problem.
							</p>
							<h2 style="size:8px">Problem Statement</h2>
							<!-- <p>Stay tooned! The problem statement will be released the morning of the event :)</p> -->
							
							
							<!-- UNCOMMENT MORNING OF -->
							<p style="font-size:18px">We have developed two problem statements for you to choose from. <br> <b>Please pick only one problem area to explore and design for.</b>
								If neither of those options interest you, feel free to create your own problem statement to design for.
							</p>

							<h3>1. School to Prision Pipeline</h3>
							
							<p>								
								The ACLU describes the school to prison pipeline as “a national trend wherein children are funneled out of public schools and into the juvenile and criminal justice 
								systems. Many of these children have <b>learning disabilities</b> or histories of <b>poverty</b>, <b>abuse</b>, or <b>neglect</b>, and would benefit from additional 
								educational and counseling services.”
							</p>	
							<br>
							<p>

							<br>
							<p><b>
								You are a mobile app designer. You are being funded by the city to create a mobile app to aid in stopping the school-to-prison pipeline. They give you an unlimited budget 
								and are asking you to develop a creative solution to address this injustice. The city understands this is a systemic issue that cannot be solved through an app alone. 
								They are asking you to select and challenge an aspect of this disturbing trend with technology.
							</b></p>

							<p>When you are designing keep these questions in mind:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Who are you designing for?</li>
								<li>How would you format this app to ensure that it’s accessible to all people who are pushed into or soon to enter the pipeline? </li>
								<li>Think about a range of people including those with learning disabilities, those experiencing poverty, those who lack family support, or those who are failed by public schools.</li>
								<li>What kind of services should your app include?</li>
								<li>What functionality will be provided and how should that information be displayed on the app? </li>
								<li>How will you balance providing enough information to make a difference without overwhelming users?</li>

							<h3>2. Menstrual Inequity</h3>
							
							<p>								
									Menstrual Inequity - When a girl or a woman cannot afford to buy period products like tampons or pads.

									Menstrual inequity [period poverty] impacts a number of different groups across the U.S. From <b>young girls</b> who have to miss school because of a lack of access to period products, 
									to <b>women in prison</b> who are often forced to beg guards for basic hygiene products, menstrual inequity is a real issue. It can also affect <b>women experiencing homelessness</b>
									 who don’t have easy access to hygiene products.
									<br><br>
									 “<b>Stigma</b>, <b>poverty</b>, and a <b>lack of access</b> are three foundational elements that define period poverty in the U.S. today.”
							</p>	
							<br>

							<p><b>
									You are a mobile app designer. Planned Parenthood was awarded with a generous donation to specifically address the area of menstrual inequity. Planned Parenthood has hired you to design a solution that will
									 address an aspect of this inequity. They are not expecting you to solve the whole problem, rather they want you to research and select an aspect that will make an impact.
							</b></p>

							<p>When you are designing keep these questions in mind:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Who are you designing for?</li>
								<li>How would you format this app to ensure that it’s accessible to all people who are pushed into or soon to enter the pipeline? </li>
									Think about a range of people including those <b>experiencing homelessness</b>, those who are <b>victims of domestic violence</b>, those with <b>disabilities</b>, or those who are <b>young</b> and unable to drive or afford hygiene.
								<li>What kind of services should your app include?</li>
								<li>Will your app focus on one of the three foundational elements of menstrual inequity, <b>stigma</b>, <b>poverty</b>, and <b>lack of access</b> or address all three?</li>
								<li>What functionality will be provided and how should that information be displayed on the app? </li>
								<li>How will you balance providing enough information to make a difference without overwhelming users?</li>

							<h3>3. DIY: Designing to <i>disrupt</i></h3>
							
							<p>
								Today is a day about creativity! So, if you have another social justice issue you are passionate about we encourage you to go with your passion! You can still do the same design activity, though you will need to create your own problem statement. If you have any questions remember mentors are standing by to help!
							</p>

							<p>If you need inspiration, consider one of the following topic areas:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Power, privilege, oppression</li>
								<li>Educational equity</li>
								<li>Gun violence</li>
								<li>Representation in media</li>
								<li>Biased news articles</li>
								<li>Immigration policies</li>
							</ul>
